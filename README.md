# Obsidian Widgets

## Usage

To insert a widget, simply add a code block with the language `widgets` and add your options to the body

![Countdown](public/countdown.png)

#### Configuration Body:

`type`: countdown

`date`: Accepts either the standard format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` or relative time expressions such as `+Ns` (seconds), `+Nm` (minutes), `+Nh` (hours), and `+Nd` (days), where `N` is a numerical value.

`show`: Controls what is showed on the countdown. Accepts a list of words that can be "years", "days", "hours", "minutes", "seconds". The list must be comma-divided. e.g.: `show: years, hours, minutes`. Defaults to showing all (optional)

`to`: Description of the countdown (optional)

`completedLabel`: The label to show when the countdown is complete (optional)

`excludeWeekends`: Set to "true" to exclude weekends (Saturday and Sunday) from the countdown (optional)

`excludedDates`: Comma-separated list of dates to exclude from the countdown. Can be:
- Single dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Date ranges in `YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD` format
- A combination of both
Example: `2024-04-11:2024-04-22, 2024-04-25` (optional)

#### Example

````
```widgets
type: countdown
date: 2024-01-01 00:00:00
to: New Year! ðŸŽ‰
completedLabel: Happy new year! ðŸŽ‰
excludeWeekends: true
excludedDates: 2024-12-25:2024-12-31
```
````

## Counter

![Counter](public/counter.png)

#### Configuration Body:

`type`: counter

`text`: the text label below the counter

`id`: the id of the counter. Use this if you want to have more than one counter in the same note (optional)

`increment`: The increment/decrement value that the counter will use to add and subtract from the count. Defaults to 1 if not present (optional)

`startValue`: A starting value for the counter. Will reset to that value if the reset button is clicked. Defaults to 0 if not present (optional)

#### Notice

The counter widget is supported multiple times by note if you provide an unique `id` per counter. If you add more than one counter widget to a note without an `id`, they will share the same count. To sync the count between devices, make sure your `.obsidian/plugins` folder is synced between devices. This is where Obsidian stores the data for this plugin

#### Example

````
```widgets
type: counter
text: Push-ups
id: push-ups
```
````

## Customizing your widgets

We currently do not support and don't plan to support customizing styles and colors of each widget via options in the widgets code block. Each widget is set to respect your theme's colors. That does not mean you can further customize the look of your widgets to your liking via CSS Snippets.

If you want to customize your widgets, please follow the [guide](STYLING.md)

## Widget View

Obsidian Widgets comes with a command to add a Widget as a view to your workspace. This is useful if you want to have a widget always visible on your workspace. To use the command, open the Command Pallete (Ctrl + P) and select "Open widget view"

## Command Pallete

Obsidian Widgets also comes with a handy command on the command pallete (Ctrl+P) to add widgets on the fly
